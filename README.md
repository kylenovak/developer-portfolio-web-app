# Developer Portfolio Web App
I built a web app using Python, Flask, JavaScript, JQuery, HTML, CSS, SASS, Postgres, SQL, SQLAlchemy, Heroku, and more. The purpose of this project was to highlight my skills and experience as a developer; it was a developer portfolio site.

I hosted the app on Heroku at kylejnovak.com, but i have since shutdown the app because I wanted to rebuild it with a different tech stack.

## Achievements
What I achieved from this project was that I got to learn a lot of tools that I hadn't used before, as well as launch a full featured app onto the web!

## Features
Project features included:

- Admin console with login/logout capability.
- CMS (Content Management System)
- Twitter API to pull in my latest tweets
- Github API to pull in my latest starred repos
- Gmail API to send email on the contact form
