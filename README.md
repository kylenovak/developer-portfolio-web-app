# Developer Portfolio Web App
I built a web app using Python, Flask, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, SASS, Postgres, SQL, SQLAlchemy, Heroku, and more.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to highlight my skills and experience as a developer; it was a developer portfolio site.

## Live
I hosted the app on Heroku at kylejnovak.com, but i have since shutdown the app because I wanted to rebuild it with a different tech stack.

## Achievements
What I achieved from this project was that I got to learn a lot of tools that I hadn't used before or wasn't too familiar with (i.e. Flask, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, SASS/SCSS, and Heroku), as well as launch a full featured app onto the web!

## Features
Project features include:

- Responsive web design
- CSS Transitions and Animations
- Admin console with login/logout capability
- CMS (Content Management System)
- Twitter API to pull in my latest tweets
- Github API to pull in my latest starred repos
- Gmail API to send email on the contact form
